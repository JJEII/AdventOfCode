            <details class="problem-part" id="day4p1"><summary>Part 1</summary>
                <p>It's fairly straightforward to load the data into a grid; run through each location in it; check that it's a roll and, if so, assess what's in its immediate surroundings in order to determine if it's reachable or not; counting the reachable results the whole time, as you go. Although, that may be a little exacting in terms of getting the details right, it's not "hard" to do.</p>
                <details><summary>A better way ...</summary>
                    <p>Instead of loading everything into a grid, if you load into a set only the (row, col) coordinates of just the rolls of paper, then you will subsequently iterate only through rolls (skipping all empty locations), and you only need to check if immediately surrounding (row, col) locations are in that set when counting how many rolls are adjacent to each.</p>

                <details><summary>In the case of the "better" way in Part 1 ...</summary>
                    <p>You just remove every reachable roll in each iteration to set up for the following iteration, until there's nothing more to remove, counting along the way (or just remembering the original size, then subtracting the final size from it at the end).</p>

            <details class="problem-part" id="day5p1"><summary>Part 1</summary>
                <p>Just do it. Not sure what else to say. This may be the easiest problem of this year's event so far.</p>
                <details><summary>One obvious optimization</summary>
                    <p>When iterating through the ranges, terminate the instant one is found that fits, rather than finishing checking all of them. (But, I think it's almost harder to <em>not</em> terminate then than to terminate.)</p>
                    <p><code>any(...)</code> is probably a good option to leverage here since its evaluation short-circuits.</p>
                    <p><code>sum(...)</code></p>

            </details>
            <details class="problem-part" id="day5p2"><summary>Part 2</summary>
                <p>This one's a bit more tricky, but not too bad.</p>
                <details><summary>Fundamentally, the problem to solve is ...</summary>
                    <p>... counting every "fresh ID" exactly once, instead of multiple times, because the provided ranges overlap with each other in various ways, and they must be processed <em>as ranges</em> because simply iterating through all IDs between the minimum range low value and the maximum range high value isn't feasible due to how large the range values are.</p>
                    <details><summary>There are two obvious ways to resolve overlapping ranges ...</summary>
                        <p>... shrink ranges, as needed, when they overlap, so they no longer do. But, this doesn't necessarily work very well in some situations, such as if some ranges exist entirely inside other ranges, or at least are entirely overlapped by some combination of other ranges. And, even if you do get this working properly, it still will generally yield more resulting ranges than when using the next approach.</p>
                        <p>... merge ranges, as needed, when they overlap, so they no longer do. But, then the challenge is to identify subsets of <em>all</em> ranges that are merge-able into respectively representative single ranges.</p>
                        <details><summary>There are several ways to approach the merge problem, but probably the best is ...</summary>
                            <p>... to first ascendingly sort all the ranges by their low values (with tie-breaks by their end values). See <code>sorted(...)</code>, or <code>[].sort()</code>.</p>
                            <details><summary>Then, iterate through them, tracking ...</summary>
                                <p>... an intermittently changing start value and whether or not the currently assigned end value is &ge; to the following range's low value. (Technically, you can merge on end &ge; low-1, but you don't need to.)</p>
                                <details><summary>If it is, then set end to ...</summary>
                                    <p>... <code>max(end, high)</code>, and continue.</p>
                                    <p>If it's not, then add (start, end) to a set of merged ranges, and set start and end to the current range's low and high, respectively, to begin merging a new range, then continue.</p>
                                    <p>Once done, simply sum the lengths of all merged ranges to get the total count of fresh IDs.</p>
                                    <p>Note that it is also possible to accumulate totals on the fly (which should be more performant than storing merged ranges and later summing them), but beware of accounting for the final sorted-input range because its factoring-in with regard to merging or not, while inside versus outside the loop, is dependent upon the input data.</p>

                <p>Not at all straightforward, even though it (at least initially) "feels like it should be", which I found rather frustrating while working through it.</p>
                <p>In fact, this may be the hardest problem part of the year, and I suspect that almost everybody who "solved" it ... didn't actually solve it and instead just accidentally got lucky with the problem's particular input data. (I know for a fact that of the six different independent code "solutions" I ran on some test data I created (below), <em>all</em> of them failed to assess it correctly, and that included my own.)</p>
                <p>We all misread the actual problem being asked, and we simply got lucky that the input data was designed in the shape it was, so our solutions to our misreadings of the problem were coincidentally "correct" in this specific case. Had the input data better flexed to test the problem's constraints, we'd all have needed to work harder on the problem to solve it properly.</p>
                <p>I'm providing some test data here for people to try out, which far better exercise solution code than the actual problem's input data did. (Triple-click inside one of the sets to select it, for easier copying.) I'm also providing the correct maximum area for valid rectangles in each, to compare against. (I include additional solution details inside the spoiler-fold below.)</p>

                <p>I had initially misread the problem to be asking for the maximum area of all "in bounds" rectangles, so I had written a "solution" to enforce that no data-points were inside a valid rectangle, no segments intruded into/across any valid rectangle, and no valid rectangle possessed any edge overlapping by more than one unit with a boundary segment with opposite winding direction. This just happened to turn up the correct answer for the problem's input data, because that data did not well-exercise the problem's constraints.</p>
                <p>But, this is not, in fact, what the problem asks for: "Using two red tiles as opposite corners, what is the largest area of any rectangle you can make using only red and green tiles?"</p>
                <p><strong>This formulation allows the boundary to enter/exit/wind-around-inside a max rectangle <em>so long as there is never any 'gap' between the intruding boundary lines!</em></strong></p>
                <p>EXAMPLE - The most obvious largest-rectangle (area=12x5=60, made by the highlighted red points) in the following dataset is <em>valid</em> because every tile within it is either red (#) or green (|, -, or .), exactly as the problem demands. ("Outside" is indicated by blue x.) It does not matter that the boundary enters and exits the rectangle; it remains valid because there are no gaps (blue x) between.

                <p>With this very different way of understanding the problem and thinking about how to solve it (also quite differently), I wrestled for a while with how on Earth to try to tackle it.</p>
                <details><summary>I eventually landed on the idea of ...</summary>
                    <p>... subdividing any selected rectangle into "empty regions" within it (<em>i.e.</em>, regions that are left over inside the rectangle after carving it up by "removing" overall-boundary edges), and then testing each of those regions for "inside-ness" versus "outside-ness". If any of them ends up as "outside", the entire rectangle is invalid; if all are "inside", the rectangle is valid.</p>
                    <details><summary>To test "inside-ness", I ...</summary>
                        <p>... performed a horizontal ray-cast out of each region to beyond the dataset's limits, counting boundary/edge crossings along the way. An odd count means "inside", an even count means "outside".</p>
                        <p>Note that doing this comes with its own complications due to the possibility of the ray aligning exactly along some number of horizontal edges, in which case it matters what the edges connecting to each end are doing.</p>
                        <details><summary>However, this is fairly straightforwardly resolved with the trick of ...</summary>
                            <p>... offsetting the ray's y-coordinate by a small amount to avoid alignment issues&mdash;for example, by &pm;0.5.</p>
                        </details>
                    </details>
                    <aside>Note: When I eventually developed this solution, it ran more slowly than I would have liked (a few minutes?). I know there are some things I could do to speed it up, but also it may be better to precompute (for the entire dataset) all the "outside" regions first (via almost exactly the same technique, but on a bounding-box rectangle for the whole dataset), then during the main run, test each selected rectangle for intersections with any of those "outside rectangles". If there's an intersection found, the selected rectangle is invalid; if not, it's valid. Maybe this would be better, and maybe not. (The "outside" rectangles could, for example, be arranged in a tree structure for efficient querying, or whatever... but, I haven't tested this idea.)</aside>
                    <details><summary>It was not clear to me how <em>exactly</em> to carve up rectangles, but the way I ended up doing it was ...</summary>
                        <p>... by performing a "sweep" from left to right across the rectangle, evaluating the state of a vertical cross-section only when it changes&mdash;so, at every vertical segment (sorted by x), and in-between them if there's a gap.</p>
                        <details><summary>For each unit-wide "vertical slice", I ...</summary>
                            <p>... already knew which vertical segments were in-play (since I'd previously done the bookkeeping for that), so I sliced through the horizontal segments to bring in all of those also in-play for that x-value slice (all clipped to the selected rectangle's bounds, of course). I represented all the vertical and horizontal segments as (low, high) y-ranges (horizontal-edge "y-ranges" being only size 1), y-sorted them all, and performed a "range merge" much like what was done for <a href="#day5p2">Day 5 Part 2</a> (also merging ranges directly juxtaposed). The result was the ranges of 'filled' locations, which I used to produce an inverted set of ranges for what was empty within that slice of rectangle (if anything).</p>
                            <p>For each of these slices' empty ranges, I could have tested "inside-ness" using the same ray-cast technique described above. However, I didn't want to produce legions of these, with large subsets of them likely parts of the same "empty regions", and then test every single one of them for "inside-ness" rather than just testing every "empty region" as a whole, just once each.</p>
                            <details><summary>To accomplish this single ray-cast per region, I...</summary>
                                <p>... used union-find to merge adjacent (with successive slices) empty ranges into larger "empty regions", then performed a single ray-cast test only on each region's "representative slice-range".</p>
                            </details>
                            <details><summary>Big performance-improvement spoilers related to my note above...</summary>
                                <p>In order to (drastically!) speed things up, I implemented a couple of important changes, with all the heavy lifting being done as precomputation.</p>
                                <p>The first was to create "compressed coordinate" mappings for both x and y directions of the input data, where all the unique x and y values mapped to their densest possible versions while still accurately representing the input structurally. Basically, I started each at 0 and incremented it by 1 if the difference between successive sorted values was only 1, and by 2 if it was &ge;2.</p>
                                <p>The second was to build summed-area table from this compressed-coordinate representation of the input. I initialized the whole table with zeros then ran my inside/outside region code on the entire compressed-coordinate dataset in order to identify "outside" regions, which I then filled into the table with 1 values throughout. From this intermediate table, I constructed a final summed-area table.</p>
                                <p>To assess each selected rectangle during the main run, I simply performed an O(1) lookup in the summed-area table, using the compressed-coordinate versions of the rectangle's coordianates. If the result is nonzero, some part of the rectangle is "outside"; if it's zero, then it's fully inside.</p>
                                <p>I kept the reverse-sorting-by-area code structure in place, too, so the first area found that works, is the largest area.</p>
                                <p>These changes dropped the runtime down to almost nothing (perhaps a couple seconds on my rather old laptop).</p>

                <p>This was substantially harder than Part 1, and it reminded me a bit of Part 2 of <a href="2024.html#day13p2">Claw Contraption</a> from 2024. (That's a bit of a hint.)</p>

                        <p>For some of the data set's problems, solving this is enough to get the answer since they're fully determined. For others, it's not. So, what do you do then?</p>

                            <p>... now it's not. Its size has been radically reduced by the math, and, fortunately, you have hard limits on each of the free variables remaining since you can easily identify bounds on the number of button presses for each: compare the goal joltages to those affected by each free-variable-button press, and select the minimum as the upper limit, per variable. (Obviously, 0 is the lower limit for all of them.) Since none of the systems in the data exceed three free variables&mdash;at least, I don't think they did in my data&mdash;you can just exhaustively try them all quite quickly, and track the minimum.</p>

                <p>Carefully analyze the input data. (Seriously. Just do it. That's the first hint.)</p>
                <details><summary>As far as I know, this problem is ...</summary>
                    <p>... <em>in the general case</em>, NP-hard. So, when I glanced at the scale of the provided input data, I was initially entirely at a loss as to how to approach it because the values appear far too large to just brute-force through.</p>
                    <p>However, I figured that, at the very least, I could examine the data in more detail to see if maybe some of the inputs could fairly easily be ruled out via a simple check or two.</p>
                    <details><summary>The first test was to ...</summary>
                        <p>... see if any of the entries were able to be rejected <em>even if they were perfectly densely packed</em> (no holes at all).</p>
                        <p>For each data input independently examined, let:
                            <ul>
                                <li>W : width of boundary region</li>
                                <li>L : length of boundary region</li>
                                <li>A<sub>R</sub> = WL : area of boundary region</li>
                                <li>n<sub>i</sub> : required number of shape i</li>
                                <li>a<sub>i</sub> : area covered by shape i, computed as its '#'-count (same across all "WxL: n<sub>i</sub> for i in 0..5" data inputs)</li>
                                <li>A<sub>D</sub> = Σ n<sub>i</sub> a<sub>i</sub> : "dense area", which is the theoretical minimum coverage area of all of an input's shapes (ignoring region shape)</li>
                                <li>N = Σ n<sub>i</sub> : total shape count</li>
                            </ul>
                            It should be obvious that if A<sub>D</sub>&gt;A<sub>R</sub>, then that input can immediately be rejected as impossible.</p>
                        <p>Imagine my surprise when literally hundreds of the inputs were rejected by this simple check!</p>
                        <aside>Frustratingly, when the problem first became available to work on, I had only tried this test on the very first input, and by hand, and I'd accidentally reversed the comparison and concluded that the boundary region area was just slightly larger than the total shape-coverage area, even though it was actually slightly <em>smaller</em>! Oof!</aside>
                        <p>At any rate, this was all fine and good to discover, but it still didn't necessarily get me much closer to a final answer since it didn't tell me whether or not those remaining (not rejected) would work, and trying to crank through even just <u>one</u> of them would be computationally infeasible.</p>
                        <details><summary>But, it did encourage me to then look more closely at those remaining inputs. I next examined ...</summary>
                            <p>... just <em>how much</em> larger A<sub>R</sub> was than A<sub>D</sub>. It turned out to be by quite a substantial amount, even for the smallest one! Now, this seemed potentially promising...</p>
                            <p>I decided to examine them in terms of ratio, too&mdash;(1 - A<sub>D</sub>/A<sub>R</sub>)&mdash;and this also showed great promise because even the smallest "excess" was still &gt;26%! That felt like quite a lot of "wiggle room".</p>
                            <details><summary>Given all this, I decided to just see what would happen if ...</summary>
                                <p>... I checked to see if all the respectively required shapes for each of the remaining regions could just be dropped in by providing it with its own little independent 3x3 tile space (since all the shapes are "3x3"), without even trying to interlock them at all. See figure.</p>
